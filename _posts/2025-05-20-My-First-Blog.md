🧠 Why a Blog?

As I deepen my journey into Data Science, I realized the best way to reinforce what I learn is by teaching it. This blog is my way of documenting projects, writing about concepts, and exploring the practical side of machine learning, statistics, and data visualization.

Whether it's a Kaggle competition, a portfolio project, or a cool trick in Pandas — if I learn it, I’ll write about it.

🔧 Tech Stack

This blog is built using:

Jekyll – A static site generator that's perfect for developers.
Chirpy – A clean, fast, and feature-rich Jekyll theme optimized for blogging.
GitHub Pages – Free hosting with version control and CI/CD baked in.
No databases, no servers — just Markdown and Git.
